# Introduction to AWS Glue

- AWS Glue is a fully-managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to move data between data stores. 

- It can automatically discover and infer schemas from various data sources, transform and clean the data using built-in or custom transformations, and load the data into a destination data store. 

- AWS Glue is designed to be scalable, reliable, and cost-effective, and allows you to easily create and manage ETL jobs without having to provision or manage any infrastructure.


# When to Use AWS Glue

- AWS Glue is a great choice when you need to move data between different data stores, such as from a relational database to a data warehouse, or from a streaming data source to a data lake.

- It can handle large volumes of data and can automatically scale up or down based on the size of your data and the complexity of your ETL jobs. 

- AWS Glue can also be used for data preparation and cleaning tasks, such as data deduplication, normalization, and enrichment.
